## Rendezvous
In short, Rendezvous is a platform for finding the right people for your project. People with an idea submit their project with details on which kind of resources are needed (e.g. front-end developer), while people interested in contributing to a project login with their with their LinkedIn credentials so that their skills (e.g. jQuery) are fetched automatically. Users may search the projects and people based on the skills and geographical proximity.
